# Conference Central

This application was created as my submission for project 4 of Udacity's
Full Stack Nanodegree program.  The objective of project 4 is develop a
EndPoints using Google's App Engine.  All of the work done was focused on the
back end and creating the API.


## Design Decisions
#### Sessions
Sessions are the individual events that make up a conference.  Sessions can
have several formats.  Workshop, Lecture, Keynote, Demo and Panel have been
provided as options for the **SessionType**.  Since you can not have a
session without a conference, sessions require a conference key to be passed
under **parentConfKey**.  This conference key is used to establish an ancestor
relationship between the conference and the session. In addition to
**parentConfKey**, the **name** property is also a required field.  To prevent
unwanted sessions being created, only the creator of a conference can add
sessions to it.

#### Speakers
In their current capacity, speakers are associated with most sessions as the
main attraction.  Since a speaker can attend more than one session, or even
more than one conference, speakers are there own entity with the following
properties: **name**, **briefBio**, **company** and **projects**.  **name**
is the only required property for a speaker.  A speaker has no ancestor
relationship since a speaker can attend multiple conferences and sessions.

#### Session & Speaker Relationship
A speaker is added to a session using the speaker's key, through the session's
**speakerKey**.  A session's **speakerKey** property allows for more than one
speaker since sessions can have multiple speakers or a panel.  Each key is
passed is verified individually and an exception is thrown if one is invalid.

#### Featured Speakers
A featured speaker is defined as a speaker that is assigned to two or more
sessions within a conference.  When a session is created within
`_createSessionObject()`, a check is performed on each **speakerKey** that is
passed in.  For each speakerKey, the number of sessions for the speaker is
calculated.  The speaker with the most sessions is then set as the featured
speaker and added to the task queue through `_cacheFeaturedSpeaker()` to be
added to memcache.  If there is a tie for number of sessions, the last speaker
passed is assigned the featured speaker.

#### User Wish Lists
A User can add sessions to their wish list using `addSessionToWishlist()` and
passing in the session key.  A user must be registered to the parent
conference of a session to add it to their wish list.  The session's key is
added to the user's profile under the **sessionWishList** property.  A user
can also remove a session from their wish list using
`removeSessionFromWishlist()`.  Additionally you can retrieve all sessions in
a user's wish list by calling getSessionWishlist() while a user is authed.

#### Additional Queries
- `getSpeakersByConference()` takes in a conference key and returns all
speakers in that conference, regardless of session.  This can be used to
quickly see the speaker lineup for an entire conference.
- `getConferenceSessionsByDate()` takes in a conference key and date to return
all sessions for the parent conference matching the specified date.  This
would allow a participant to decided what days might be more valuable to them
based on the sessions that are available.

#### Query Problem Solution
**Question posed in project:** Letâ€™s say that you don't like workshops and you
don't like sessions after 7 pm. How would you handle a query for all non-
workshop sessions before 7 pm? What is the problem for implementing this query?
What ways to solve it did you think of?

###### The Problem
The problem here is that we are trying to perform inequality filters on two
separate properties.  Within Datastore, inequality filters can only be applied
to one property.  Additionally, any properties with an inequality filter must
be sorted first, all though this is not an issue with the above problem.

###### Possible Solutions
- **Comparing two separate queries:** The first solution that I thought of was
to perform two separate queries, one for sessions no later then 7pm and another
for sessions that are not workshops.  With both of these queries complete, the
results can then be compared and only the matching sessions will be returned as
the result.  
This was the solution that I used in `getConferenceSessionsByTimeAndType()`
- **Filter results programmatically:** This solution would perform a query on
the database and then filter the results using the language of choice; Python
in this case.  In the above example, we could query for sessions that are not
workshops and store them locally.  We could then filter the stored results by
**startTime**.
- **Combinding properties into new property:** This is a solution that I found
through a bit of Googling that peaked my interest.  From what I have read, this
would be a great solution for larger data bases that have a specific multi-
property inequality filter that is used frequently.  Essentially we would need
to rewrite the Model and session creation function so that the **startTime**
property and **typeOfSession** property could be combined into a new value.  
This one was a little over my head, but I found it interesting enough to
include.
